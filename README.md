## Description

This project took a fully functioning Google Books API application originally built with RESTful API and refactored it to be a GraphQl API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The purpose of this project was to practice a real world scenario that we are likley to encounter while on the job and put to use principals I learned in coding class.
